# Overview

The 23rd Annual Workshop of the Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA) will be held at the University of Sydney, Sydney, from the 26th to the 28th of November, 2025. 

The organisers aim to provide livestreaming for remote attendees. Presenters who are unable to travel for various reasons (health, caring requirements, visa status, costs, etc.) are offered an online channel. With a hybrid format, we aim to increase the accessibility of participating in research communities throughout the workshop.

The ALTA 2025 workshop is the key local forum for socialising research results in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics (CL). It will feature presentations, posters, and demonstrations from students, industry, and academic researchers. Like previous years, we also encourage submissions and participation from industry and government researchers and developers.

Note that ALTA is listed in the CORE 2023 Conference Rankings as Australasian C. See details from the CORE Rankings Portal.

# Topics

We particularly encourage submissions that broaden the scope of our community by considering practical applications of language technology and multidisciplinary research. We also specifically encourage submissions from the industry.

# Format

We invite submissions of three different formats: (1) Original Research Papers, (2) Non-Archival Submissions, and (3) Industry Demonstrations.

## (1) Original Research Papers

We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all aspects of NLP and CL.

Long papers should be 7-8 pages, and short papers should be 3-4 pages (see further details below). The format should follow the [ACL Rolling Review guidelines](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp).

Accepted papers will either be delivered as an oral presentation or as a poster presentation. We only accept poster presentations for participants who are presenting on-site. In addition to the page count requirements, both short and long papers may include unlimited pages of references.

Note that the review process is double-blind, and accordingly, submitted papers should not include the identity of the author(s) and the text should be suitably anonymised, e.g. using third-person wording for self-citations, not providing URLs to your personal website, properly anonymising public repositories, etc. Original research papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which will be published online in the ACL anthology and the ALTA website. Long papers will be distinguished from short papers in the proceedings.

## (2) Non-archival submissions

To encourage broader participation and facilitate local socialisation of international results (such as papers published elsewhere), we invite non-archival submissions. Accepted non-archival submissions will have the opportunity for a lightning presentation at the workshop.

Submissions should include the presentation title and abstract, the name of the presenter, any publications relating to the work, and any information on collaboration with the local ALTA community. A submission can optionally consist of more just the title and abstract if, for example, it is based on a paper published elsewhere or a preprint; there is no page limit on non-archival submissions as such, and it maybe include these published papers or preprints. Non-archival submissions will not be published in the proceedings but simply reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to ensure that they are on topic, coherent, and likely to be of interest to the ALTA community. Submissions on work in progress and work published or submitted elsewhere are encouraged. ALTA invites submissions of all manner of interesting research, not limited to but including:

- Papers accepted or published at *CL or similar venues by researchers in the ALTA region
- Established academics giving an overview of an exciting paper or paper/s published in international venues
- Completing research students giving an overview of their thesis work
- Early candidature research students presenting their work in progress and ideas that may not have been published
- Industry submissions that are not intended to be archival

Presentation abstracts should not be anonymised, any publications relating to the work should be cited in the submission, and the person who will give the presentation should be clearly stated.

## (3) Industry Demonstrations

To encourage industry participation and networking opportunities, we are thrilled to announce a track for industry demonstrations, which provides an exciting opportunity for industry researchers to showcase their NLP applications. You should submit a proposal that is 1-2 pages long, containing (1) a description of the software, tools or applications that will be presented and how NLP techniques are used to address a specific problem and (2) a brief introduction of your organisation. We particularly encourage startups using NLP models to submit a proposal. The proposals will be reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to select demonstrations that best align with the interests of the ALTA community.

# Multiple Submission

Original research papers under review for other publication venues or that you intend to submit elsewhere may be submitted in parallel to ALTA. We require that you declare at submission that your paper has been submitted to another venue and identify the venue. Should your paper be accepted to ALTA and another venue, we will allow you to decide whether the paper should be published in the ALTA proceedings or treated as a presentation (without archival publication). In this case, you can still present a research talk at the ALTA workshop. This is to encourage more internationally leading research to be presented at the workshop.

# Instructions for Authors

## Paper Submission

Authors should submit their papers via OpenReview:

- [Archival paper submission](https://openreview.net/group?id=ALTA.asn.au/2025/Workshop_Archival)
- [Non-archival paper submission](https://openreview.net/group?id=ALTA.asn.au/2025/Workshop_Non-Archival)
- Commitment site for ARR reviews (coming soon)

## Important Notice Regarding OpenReview Profile Creation

We would like to notify authors about OpenReview’s profile creation policy:

Profiles created without an institutional email (e.g., using Gmail, Yahoo, etc.) will undergo a moderation process that may take up to two weeks for approval.
Profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically without any delay.
To avoid any delays, we strongly recommend using an institutional email when creating your OpenReview profile. Otherwise, please be aware of the potential two-week moderation period and plan accordingly towards the paper submission deadline.

Thank you for your understanding.

## Formatting Guidelines
Submissions must follow the two-column ACL format. We therefore strongly recommend you use LaTeX style files from <https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files>. That website also provides a Microsoft Word template, which may be used, but be very careful to ensure the formatting is correct (this has been an issue in past years).

## Paper Length
Long papers:
7-8 pages of content.
Plus, unlimited pages of references and appendices.

Short papers:
3-4 pages.
Plus, unlimited pages of references and appendices.

About the appendices: While the appendix length is unlimited, it is essential to notify the authors that reviewers are not required to read it. The main text should be self-explanatory, with the appendix used only to highlight additional details.

Abstract submissions ideally should be a few paragraphs. Note, this does not refer to the abstract of a paper, but rather to standa-alone abstracts in the non-archival track.

Industry demonstration proposals should be 1-2 pages.

## Anonymisation

Short and long paper submissions must be anonymised.
Abstracts are NOT to be anonymised and must include the author’s/authors’ affiliation.

We follow the post-2024 ARR approach to preprints.
There is no anonymity period or limitation on posting or discussing non-anonymous preprints while the work is under peer review.
