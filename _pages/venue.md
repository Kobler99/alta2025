### Getting to Sydney

#### By Air

[Sydney airport](https://www.sydneyairport.com.au/) is a large transport hub catering for international and domestic flights. 

Once at Sydney Airport, there are many options for getting to the conference venue. Sydney is well serviced by taxis and ridesharing services. You can also take a train from the aiport to Central Station, which costs [~$22.25 during peak time](https://airportlink.com.au/trip-information/price/). Once at Central Station, catch a train to Redfern Station (this takes a few minutes) where the conference venue is a short 10-minute (700m) walk away.

#### By Rail

There are many trains connecting Greater Sydney to Sydney. There are also [regional trains to Central Station](https://transportnsw.info/regional-travel/booking-information/regional-tickets). Once at Central Station, catch a train to Redfern Station (this takes a few minutes) where the conference venue is a short 10-minute (700m) walk away.

#### By Road

Sydney is a 3 to 3.5 hour drive from Canberra, and an 8.5 to 9.5 hour drive from Melbourne.

It can be challenging to find parking at the university during teaching periods. Luckily, ALTA25 will be occurring during the student's exam period, so parking should be more available (though, parking availability is difficult to anticipate). On campus casual parking can be paid for using parking meters or the CellOPark app. See [this page](https://www.sydney.edu.au/about-us/campuses/getting-to-campus.html) from the University of Sydney for more details.


Students coming to ALTA25 can arrange for $14 parking at the nearby Broadway Shopping Centre. Students must prearrange this though. See [this page](https://www.broadwaysydney.com.au/visit/parking) for more details.

## Accommodation

There are many hotels around the University of Sydney, and in Sydney city in general. We recommend choosing a hotel near a rail line that goes to Redfern station, as Redfern station is a short walk from the conference venue.

For staying within walking distance, one good option is Adina Apartment Hotel Sydney Chippendale.
